# Fitness Guide
As a participant of many guided, high intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts, I was curious about how the coaches know when to cue the next exercise or announce the time remaining. Fitness Guide is a mobile app designed to guide a coach through a 27 minute HIIT treadmill workout with 19 sequences. The app includes two timers: overall time remaining and sequence time remaining. It highlights the active sequence and lists the upcoming sequences. Fitness Guide was built using React Native and the Expo CLI.

## Getting Started
